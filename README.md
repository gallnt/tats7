# Notes and Exercises for The Analysis of Time Series Seventh Edition

This github repository is served to put in my own notes and solutions to exercises to the seventh edition of The Analysis of Time Series: An Introduction with R by Chris Chatfield and Haipeng Xin. 

Of course, there will be mistakes (both in the notes and the exercises) because I am human. Please let me know if there is a mistake so I can fix it!
